### How to start new pages
When you want to start new pages, the first thing to do is go to the github repository, the page for this website on github, and click the period key on your keyboard. This will open a code editor that will work alot better than just github. When creating a new page, first find the category that it fits into by opening the pages folder. Then add a new file in the folder, paste the boilerplate.html file in, and fill it out! If you have any questions, let me know at storm.networks.info@gmail.com or consult the video tutorial.
